The Perl 6 Ecosystem: An Author's View
from a Github User's Perspective

This is from the viewpoint of a Perl 6 module author who
wants to ease the drudgery of maintaining the proper
entries of his modules in the current ecosystem.

Currently the ecosystem consists of a list of references
to a modules META6.json file (or to its META.info file,
not a recommended practice).

First realize the desired goal is to enter only versioned
releases into the ecosystem. Many of the current modules
in the ecosystem are the master branch so a user may
not be able to recreate a desired state of a module because
that state may change without notice. 

Here are two entries found in the META.list file at 
https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem. The first
points to the master branch of the module, so each time
the module is installed, the state can be different:

  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colomon/ABC/master/META6.json

The second entry points to a commit hash so its state will
be the same for future installations. 

  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/araraloren/Getopt-Kinoko/ce039ba1ea5c238df55468692426a823645f4a61/META6.json

Several pieces of information for a release
module may be enteredkkkk, all found in the META6.json file.

Here is an example of a minimum META6.json file for a module
entered into the ecosystem:

{
  "perl": "6",
  "name": "Foo::Bar",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Miscellaneous stuff for practicing module development",

  "source-url": "https://github.com/tbrowder/Foo-Bar-Perl6/archive/1.0.0.zip",
  "auth": "github:tbrowder",
  "license": "Artistic-2.0",
  "provides": {
    "Foo::Bar": "lib/Foo/Bar.pm6"
  },
}

Note it is a release as indicated by the source-url entry pointing to
a zip archive with the release version tag as its base name.
