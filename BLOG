The Perl 6 Ecosystem: An Author's View
from a Github User's Perspective

This is from the viewpoint of a Perl 6 module author who
wants to ease the drudgery of maintaining the proper
entries of his modules in the current ecosystem.

Currently the ecosystem consists of a list of references
to a modules META6.json file (or to its META.info file,
not a recommended practice).

First realize the desired goal is to enter only versioned
releases into the ecosystem. Many of the current modules
in the ecosystem are the master branch so a user may
not be able to recreate a desired state of a module because
that state may change without notice. 

Here are two entries found in the ??? file at ????. The first
points to the master branch of the module, so each time
the module is installed, the state can be different:

The second entry points to a commit hash so its state will
be the same for future reinstallations. 

Several pieces of information are required to enter a release
module, all found in the META6.json file.
